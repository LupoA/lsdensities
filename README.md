# LSDensities: Lattice Spectral Densities


**lsdensities** is a Python library for the calculation of
smeared spectral densities from lattice correlators.

Solutions can be obtained with the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.06476.pdf">Hansen Lupo Tantalo</a> method
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.18125.pdf">
Bayesian inference with Gaussian Processes</a>, or combinations of the two.

This library is based on <a href="https://mpmath.org/">mpmath</a>
for performing the high-precision arithmetic operations that are necessary
for the solution of the inverse problem.


## Authors

Niccol√≤ Forzano, Alessandro Lupo.

## Installation

One can download, build and install the package

```bash
pip install https://github.com/LupoA/lsdensities
```

## Usage

Preliminary tests can be found in the ``tests`` folder, and tested using the ``pytest`` command.

Usage examples can be found in the ``examples`` folder.

The most basic workflow is illustrated in `examples/runExact.py`,
which generates a high-precision correlator, and computes the corresponding spectral density smeared with one of the
available kernels.

A realistic example is shown in ```examples/runInverseProblem.py```, where input data for the correlator
needs to be provided.

The most complete class is `src/lsdensities/InverseProblemWrapper.py`, which
provides utilities for estimating errors and treating
the bias both in the HLT and in the Bayesian framework.

Function call example:

```python
from lsdensities.utils.rhoUtils import (init_precision, Inputs)
from mpmath import mp, mpf
from lsdensities.core import Smatrix_mp
from lsdensities.transform import h_Et_mp_Eslice, y_combine_central_Eslice_mp
from lsdensities.utils.rhoMath import gauss_fp

# compute the smeared spectral density at some energy,
# from a lattice correlator

init_precision(128)
parameters = Inputs()
parameters.time_extent = 32
parameters.kerneltype = 'FULLNORMGAUSS'  # Kernel smearing spectral density
parameters.periodicity = 'EXP'  # EXP / COSH for open / periodic boundary conditions
parameters.sigma = 0.25  # smearing radius in given energy units
peak = 1    #   energy level in the correlator
energy = 0.5     # energy at which the smeared spectral density
                 # is evaluated in given energy units
parameters.assign_values()  # assigns internal variables
                            # based on given inputs
                            # such as tmax = number of data points,
                            # which is inferred from time_extent and periodicity,
                            # if not specified

lattice_correlator = mp.matrix(parameters.tmax, 1)  #  vector; fill with lattice data
lattice_covariance = mp.matrix(parameters.tmax)     #  matrix; fill with data covariance

for t in range(parameters.tmax):    # mock data
    lattice_correlator[t] = mp.exp(-mpf(t + 1) * mpf(str(peak)))
    lattice_covariance[t,t] = lattice_correlator[t] * 0.02


regularising_parameter = mpf(str(1e-6))   # regularising parameters; must be tuned.
                                          # Automatic tuning is provided in InverseProblemWrapper.py
                                          # this example has exact data, so the parameters
                                          # can be made as small as zero,
                                          # in which case the result will be exact in
                                          # the limit of infinite tmax

regularised_matrix = Smatrix_mp(parameters.tmax, alpha_=0) + (regularising_parameter * lattice_covariance)
matrix_inverse = regularised_matrix**(-1)

coeff = h_Et_mp_Eslice(matrix_inverse,   # linear coefficients
                       parameters,
                       energy,
                       alpha_=0)

result = y_combine_central_Eslice_mp(coeff,     # linear combination of data
                                     lattice_correlator,
                                     parameters)

true_value = gauss_fp(peak, energy, parameters.sigma, norm="full")

print("Result: ", float(result))   # reconstructed smeared spectral density at E = energy
print("Exact results :", true_value)  # exact smeared spectral density at E = energy
